So why am I here? I put a picture up on my website the other day and Ed thought
that, since we're all here because we care about geospatial data, I'd like to
share some of what I did and why with you.

It turns out that drawing maps with Javascript is really pretty straightforward
with help from appropriately-chosen libraries, and that with a little bit effort
we can produce cartographic visualisations that are even more effective at
communicating data we care about.
