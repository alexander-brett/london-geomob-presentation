# Coding Cartography
## Effectively Communicating Geospatial Data with Javascript
### alexander-brett.co.uk
???

Hi everybody, it's great to be here this evening.
---

# Motivation

???

I put a picture up on my website the other day and Ed thought that...
--

- We care about geospatial data
???
...since we're all here because we care about geospatial data, I'd like to
share some of what I did and why with you.
--

- Maps are easy
???
It turns out that drawing maps with Javascript is really pretty straightforward
with help from appropriately-chosen libraries...
--

- Good visualisations are also easy
???

...and that with a little bit of effort
we can produce cartographic visualisations that are even more effective at
communicating data we care about.

# Content

- We're going to draw pictures.
???
We're going to make some pretty pictures using javascript.
Ed sent us all instructions not to show screens full of code...
--
<br/>
- We're going to look at code.
???
.. which I'm going to ignore.
